# FDT

Estimation of the Frequency Doubling Time of 1-day and 7-day rainfall extremes over global land regions: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/ad9f12

The FDT is the time (in years) necessary for a T-year extreme (estimated at time t) to become a T'-year extreme, with T' = T/2

The T-year extreme is derived from a non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (NS-GEV) distribution fitted to the 1950-2100 sample of annual maxima of 1-day and 7-day precipitation accumulation (RX1D and RX7D, respectively)

Using daily precipitation data from 5 CMIP6 GCM ensembles: ACCESS-ESM1-5, CanESM5, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-LR
